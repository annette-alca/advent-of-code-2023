My Python solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2023/. 

All solutions in this repo are complete. And I continue to work on these challenges (to get to day25).

My solutions use a mix of matrices, arrays, recursive functions, numpy operations, and classes. They're a fun way to practice both coding and creative problem-solving.
